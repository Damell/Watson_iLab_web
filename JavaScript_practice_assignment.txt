Task 1
Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.

Task 2
Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Javascript object in the following fashion {"merry”:”veselé", "christmas”:"Vánoce", "and”:"a"} and use it to translate the text “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year".

You can access object attributes by variable with this notation: myObject[word]. The variable word here for example contains string “christmas" and so it would return string "Vánoce" as a result.
